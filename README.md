# Computer Vision for Polymer Characterisation using Lasers

This repository provides the implementation of CNN-based architecture designed for classification and regression tasks and an optimisation task. 
Solubility Image Classification - CNN models
Hansen Solubility Parameters - Genetic Algorithm
Particle Size Prediction(Regression) - CNN models


## Overview & Applications

The project consists of:
- **Classifier CNN**: A convolutional neural network designed from two to four classes image classification of solubility of polymers.
	-Soluble,
	-Insoluble,
	-Partial Soluble
	-Colloidal Soluble
- **Regressor CNN**: A convolutional neural network aimed at predicting continuous output values from image input for particle size of polymers.
	- size of polymeric nanoparticles between 20â€”440 nm

- **Genetic Optimizer**: A stothastoic optimiser for Hansen Solubility Parameters opmitisation according to the solubility classification from the CNN models.
